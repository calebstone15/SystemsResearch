The use of software reliability growth models plays an important role in measuring improvements, achieving effective and efficient test/debug scheduling during the course of a software development project, determining when to release a product or estimating the number of service releases required after release to reach a reliability goal. Many new trends in software development process standardization, in addition to established ones, emphasize the need for statistical metrics in monitoring reliability and quality improvements. In this article, we investigate the standard Gompertz and modified Gompertz models and show their applications in modeling software reliability growth using RGA. There are essentially two approaches to performing statistical reliability prediction for software. The first approach, based on design parameters, estimates the number of defects in the software using code characteristics such as numbers of lines of code, nesting of loops, external references, input/output calls, etc. The second approach is reliability growth analysis based on statistical correlations of actual defect detection data obtained during testing. Many models are used to describe reliability growth in software such as Crow-AMSAA, standard Gompertz, modified Gompertz and Lloyd-Lipow. * This article addresses the techniques available for the second approach using the Gompertz reliability growth models. Let us start with an overview of the basics of the Gompertz model an"

Reliability Analysis 5. Prediction & Growth 7. IntroductionThis topic is included in the Handbook to provide additional basic information and techniques that can be used to develop reliable software. The goal of software reliability and maintainability is to assure that software performs consistently as desired when operating within specified conditions. Depending on the level of fault or failure tolerance needed, the software should operate safely or achieve a safe state in the face of errors. Reliable software must be approached from a systems-level for both planning and execution. The software needs to be both developed and maintained in a manner where weaknesses are found and fixed with solutions designed to be robust. The maintainability assures that any updates and changes are properly scoped, designed, tested and implemented into the operational system. There are primary activities supported by software assurance that must be met at least at some level for the software to be reliable. Software assurance personnel need to support the following areas within the development cycle to help the software people achieve greater software reliability: 1) Workmanship, 2) Software Requirements Analysis, 3) Software Design Analysis, and 4) Software Safety Analysis In order to perform these activities, the various reliability activities need to be "

Reliability Growth: Enhancing Defense System Reliability. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. × Save Cancel 9 Software Reliability Growth Somewhat analogous to the topics we have covered in previous chapters for hardware systems, this chapter covers software reliability growth modeling, software design for reliability, and software growth monitoring and testing. Software reliability, like hardware reliability, is defined as the probability that the software system will work without failure under specified conditions and for a specified period of time (Musa, 1998). But software reliability differs in important respects from hardware reliability. Software reliability problems are deterministic in the sense that each time a specific set of inputs is applied to the software system, the result will be the same. This is clearly different from hardware systems, for which the precise moment of failure, and the precise cause of failure, can differ from replication to replication. In addition, software systems are not subject to wear-out, fatigue, or other forms of degradation. In some situations, reliability errors are attributed to a full system and no distinction is made between subsystems or components, and this attribution is appropriate in many applications. However, as is the case for any failure mode, there are times when it is appropriate to use separate metrics and separate assessments of subsystem or component reliabilities (with respect to system structure as well as differentiating between software and hardware reliability), which can then be aggregated for a full-system assessment. This separate treatment is particularly relevant to software failures given the different nature of software and hardware reliability. Chapter 4 on hardware reliability growth is primarily relevant to growth that occurs during full"

Selection of optimal SRGMs for use in a particular case has been an area of interest for researchers in the field of software reliability. All existing methodologies use same weight for each comparison criterion. But in reality, it is the fact that all the parameters do not have the same priority in reliability measurement. Keeping this point in mind, in this paper, a computational methodology based on weighted criteria is presented to the problem of performance analysis of various non-homogenous Poisson process (NHPP) models. It is relatively simple and requires less calculation. Read moreRelated papersQuantitative Software Reliability Modeling from Testing to OperationJung-Hua Lo2000We first describe how several existing software reliability growth models based on nonhomogeneous Poisson processes (NHPPs) can be derived based on a unified theory for NHPP models. Under this general framework, we can verify existing NHPP models and derive new NHPP models. The approach covers a number of known models under different conditions. Based on these approaches, we show a method of estimating and computing software reliability growth during the operational phase. We can use this method to describe the transitions from the testing phase to operational phase. That is, we propose a method of predicting the fault detection rate to reflect changes "

Before delivering the software in the market, it is thoroughly checked and errors are removed. Software reliability growth models help the software industries to develop such software which is error free and reliable. In this paper, a scheme for constructing software reliability growth model (SRGM) based on Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP) with Imperfect-debugging, time-variable fault reduction factor (FRF) and multiple change point is proposed. The fault reduction factor (FRF) is one of the key parameters which control the software reliability. The mean value function is established which is further employed to determine the optimal testing time. The maximum likelihood approach has been suggested to estimate the unknown parameters of the proposed model. The numerical illustration has been provided to explore the effect of various parameters on the software reliability and total expected co"

Software reliability growth models are helping the industries to produce required quality products by providing a mathematical models based on simulated testing oriented environment. Testing is the one of the costliest phase where several resources were consumed. In the history of software reliability several authors are proposed several research papers on this topic. Software reliability growth models are developed on the basis of data which was obtained during testing phase in the software engineering. In this paper we proposed a new software reliability growth model which is a enhanced model proposed by chiu. Model parameters are estimated through standard procedures. Evaluation criteria are used to analyze the performance of the proposed model and results obtained are compared with existing models. Proposed models seem to be best fit compared to all other models which are proposed earlier. software release time determination is also be done.

This concept has beenreadily worked upon in the past and is still an active area of research. Software industry has been readily evolving with time and has seen manyadvancements wherein innovation rate and creation of knowledge has playeda pivotal role for continued growth of firms. Often, the use of coming up withnew set of features in the base product has brought in answers to many user’squeries. But these up-gradations also known as add-ons also bring in certainnew flaws in the software system which is newly created. In the current paper,this fundamental has been worked upon with the help of certain proposedmodels. Results are supplemented with numerical examples. Downloads Download data is not yet available.

Patil Bharati Vidyapeeth (Deemed to be University) College of Engineering, Pune, Maharashtra, India Keywords: software testing, software reliability testing coverage, test point analysis, function point analysis Abstract Software Testing is an essential activity primarily to check the quality of the software. Software testing is necessary for checking the gap between the expectations of the requirements stated by the client and the functionalities of the software after the implementation. Testing is becoming an important milestone in the process of developing software. Executing tests is a crucial phase of project development. The testing process for software uses a lot of testing resources, including tester, the quantity of test cases run, and processor time. Software quality is becoming more important in today's competitive market. Software testing is the process of identifying faults in all sophisticated application software that is put through several programming phases. Soft"

In our blog post Don’t be Sheepish about RAMS we introduced the 4 terms reliability, availability, maintainability and safety. The first 3 are very much focussed on the area of reliability engineering. Safety is however a subject that is to a certain extent contradictory to the concepts of reliability. This though will not always be the case, e. in battery management and corresponding systems. This is an area where sustained reliable operation goes hand in hand with safety. We have written blogs previously on the demands of safety standards in both the automotive and medical device domains The continuum of safety-related delivery however, neither ISO 26262 nor IEC 62304 give any real guidance on software reliability or failure analysis. The drive in such standards tends to focus on fail-safe operation and hence avoiding a hazardous situation rather than the continued operation of the functionality. That said the automotive industry has had more focus on fail-operational systems for some years now. Software ReliabilityReliability is predominately a focus for systems engineering, but as software plays a pivotal role in most systems it is also a key topic in reliability activities. Hardware is focussed on the failure in time rates (FIT) of components, the inverse of the total FIT yields the reliability quantity Mean Time to Failure (MTTF). Software failures are however systematic by their very nature and hence random failures used in hardware are not applicable in software analysis.

    "description": "Can software failures be assimilated to probabilistic models?",
    "body": "Can software failures be assimilated to probabilistic models? This question is always a good technical discussion between engineers, mathematicians and lovers of philosophy. If software is inherently deterministic, why can we model it probabilistically? is it useful to us? In what situations or projects is it convenient for us? In this article we lay down all the most current bases by which, in certain areas and projects, we can and it is useful for us to model and talk about software failure rate/failure or probabilistic models to predict software reliability. The most used software reliability growth models or SRGMs are the Exponential Models based on Non-homogeneous Poisson Processes (NHPP) Introduction: It is now widely accepted that nontrivial software can be modeled with probabilistic models. The 3 main categories defined by the IEEE Standard 1633 ( IEEE Recommended Practice on Software Reliability , 2008) are as follows: The main conclusions and technical-philosophical bases for modeling software probabilistically today are: However, it is widely accepted that software failure is basically a deterministic process. However, due to our incomplete knowledge, we are not able to fully account for or quantify all the variables that define the failure process of complex software. Therefore, we use probabilistic models to describe and characterize it. This philosophical basis is essentially the same as that which can be used for many other probabilistic processes, such as hardware failure or coin tossing. In a coin toss, if one can control all aspects of the toss (position, velocity, and initial force, etc. ) and repeat them each time, the result will always be the same [ Diaconis 2007]. However, such control must be so precise and detailed that it is virtually impossible to replicate the launch in an identical manner outside of a laboratory environment; therefore, the result is uncertain and can be modeled as a random variable. The software may fail because the soft"

    "body": "Cumulative Software Reliability Growth Models DfRSoft offers a number of cumulative software reliability growth models. These model are based on Cumulative Time vs. Cumulative Error Data Fits. They include The Duane Model, Crow/AMSAA Model, The Logarithmic Model, and a Polynomial Fit Model. Often the Logarithmic model is the best chose. However, one should use the model that best fits the data points and projected results. The key to remember is that all the models are based on cumulative time rather than test time. Therefore one should always keep this in mind in projecting model results. Duane and Crow/AMSAAA are well known traditional reliability growth models. They can also be used in software reliability growth. All these models have advantages over the G-O model above. The max errors in the G-O model is the value A. This limits the use of the model. These models do not have this limit. They are more straight forward, being basic regression and well understood. All models are based on data fits of Cum Errors plotted against cumulative time. For the Duane and Crow/AMSAA, the result is a power law fit to the data. Beta and alpha=1-Beta are considered the growth exponent for these models. When is enough, enough for software reliability testing: DfRSoft now offers a method of slopes test criteria to help the user in assessing this."

The Center for Reliability Growth (CRG) works towards improving reliability by providing policy, guidance, standards, methods, tools, and training. In doing so, reliability, materiel/operational availability, and initial operational testing success rates can be increased while support costs and logistics footprint are decreased. The CRG maintains a collection of key reliability tools, models, and documents. By capturing and archiving actual test metrics/data, the models and tools are validated and improved. The CRG also applies resources to perform reliability or physics-of-failure analyses for select high-impact projects. Additionally, the CRG develops contract language, methodology, policy, and military handbooks & standards. The CRG allows for return on investment, reduced test time, and reduced O&S cost through the use of design-for-reliability activities. For reliability growth related questions, please e-mail usarmy.
