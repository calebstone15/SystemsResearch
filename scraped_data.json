The use of software reliability growth models plays an important role in measuring improvements, achieving effective and efficient test/debug scheduling during the course of a software development project, determining when to release a product or estimating the number of service releases required after release to reach a reliability goal. Many new trends in software development process standardization, in addition to established ones, emphasize the need for statistical metrics in monitoring reliability and quality improvements. In this article, we investigate the standard Gompertz and modified Gompertz models and show their applications in modeling software reliability growth using RGA. There are essentially two approaches to performing statistical reliability prediction for software. The first approach, based on design parameters, estimates the number of defects in the software using code characteristics such as numbers of lines of code, nesting of loops, external references, input/output calls, etc. The second approach is reliability growth analysis based on statistical correlations of actual defect detection data obtained during testing. Many models are used to describe reliability growth in software such as Crow-AMSAA, standard Gompertz, modified Gompertz and Lloyd-Lipow. * This article addresses the techniques available for the second approach using the Gompertz reliability growth models. Let us start with an overview of the basics of the Gompertz model an"

These model are based on Cumulative Time vs. Cumulative Error Data Fits. They include The Duane Model, Crow/AMSAA Model, The Logarithmic Model, and a Polynomial Fit Model. Often the Logarithmic model is the best chose. However, one should use the model that best fits the data points and projected results. The key to remember is that all the models are based on cumulative time rather than test time. Therefore one should always keep this in mind in projecting model results. Duane and Crow/AMSAAA are well known traditional reliability growth models. They can also be used in software reliability growth. All these models have advantages over the G-O model above. The max errors in the G-O model is the value A. This limits the use of the model. These models do not have this limit. They are more straight forward, being basic regression and well understood. All models are based on data fits of Cum Errors plotted against cumulative time. For the Duane and Crow/AMSAA, the result is a power law fit to the data. Beta and alpha=1-Beta are considered the growth exponent for these models. When is enough, enough for software reliability testing: DfRSoft now offers a method of slopes test criteria to help the user in assessing this."

In our blog post Don’t be Sheepish about RAMS we introduced the 4 terms reliability, availability, maintainability and safety. The first 3 are very much focussed on the area of reliability engineering. Safety is however a subject that is to a certain extent contradictory to the concepts of reliability. This though will not always be the case, e. in battery management and corresponding systems. This is an area where sustained reliable operation goes hand in hand with safety. We have written blogs previously on the demands of safety standards in both the automotive and medical device domains The continuum of safety-related delivery however, neither ISO 26262 nor IEC 62304 give any real guidance on software reliability or failure analysis. The drive in such standards tends to focus on fail-safe operation and hence avoiding a hazardous situation rather than the continued operation of the functionality. That said the automotive industry has had more focus on fail-operational systems for some years now. Software ReliabilityReliability is predominately a focus for systems engineering, but as software plays a pivotal role in most systems it is also a key topic in reliability activities. Hardware is focussed on the failure in time rates (FIT) of components, the inverse of the total FIT yields the reliability quantity Mean Time to Failure (MTTF). Software failures are however systematic by their very nature and hence random failures used in hardware are not applicable in software analysis. Software Reliability Growth ModelsThere are numerous methods defined for software reliability based "

    "body": "Models Commonly Used to Measure Reliability Growth Reliability growth is the intentional positive improvement that is made in the reliability of a product or system as defects are detected, analyzed for root cause, and removed. The process of defect removal can be ad hoc, as they are discovered during design and development, a function of an informal test-analyze-and-fix process (TAAF), or it can be as a result of formal Reliability Growth Testing (RGT). Reliability Growth Testing is performed to evaluate current reliability, identify and eliminate hardware defects and software faults, and forecast future product or system reliability. Reliability metrics are compared to planned, intermediate goals to assess progress. Depending on the achieved progress (or lack thereof), resources can be allocated (or re-allocated) to meet those goals in a timely and cost-effective manner. Three methods that are commonly used to model reliability growth are the Duane, AMSAA-Crow, and Crow Extended models. Each of these methods will be briefly described below. Detailed information pertaining to the reliability growth process (design and test) can be found in the Quanterion-authored Reliability Information Analysis Center (RIAC) publication, “Achieving System Reliability Growth Through Robust Design and Test. ” This material is also presented in RIAC’s three-day Reliability Growth training course based on the book and in the Quanterion online course “Introduction to Reliability Growth. ” Duane Model The Duane reliability growth model assumes that a plot of the log of the cumulative MTBF vs. log of cumulative test time is a straight line, the slope of which represents the growth rate. The growth rate is a measure of how quickly and efficiently failures are being discovered and removed from the design. The growth rate for most projects averages between 0. The upper limit on the growth rate is 0. 6, and growth rates above 0. Mathematically, the Duane model can be represented by: where “T"

Gulati6 Part of the book series: Advances in Intelligent and Soft Computing ((AINSC,volume 131)) 3159 Accesses 19 Citations AbstractReliability engineering plays an important role to improve the software quality. Before delivering the software in the market, it is thoroughly checked and errors are removed. Software reliability growth models help the software industries to develop such software which is error free and reliable. In this paper, a scheme for constructing software reliability growth model (SRGM) based on Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP) with Imperfect-debugging, time-variable fault reduction factor (FRF) and multiple change point is proposed. The fault reduction factor (FRF) is one of the key parameters which control the software reliability. The mean value function is established which is further employed to determine the optimal testing time. The maximum likelihood approach has been suggested to estimate the unknown parameters of the proposed model. The numerical illustration has been provided to explore the effect of various parameters on the software reliability and total expected co"

Software testing is necessary for checking the gap between the expectations of the requirements stated by the client and the functionalities of the software after the implementation. Testing is becoming an important milestone in the process of developing software. Executing tests is a crucial phase of project development. The testing process for software uses a lot of testing resources, including tester, the quantity of test cases run, and processor time. Software quality is becoming more important in today's competitive market. Software testing is the process of identifying faults in all sophisticated application software that is put through several programming phases. Soft"

It brings grassroots organizations, activists and communities’ voices to the forefront in speaking to decision-makers at the policy-level.",
    "body": "Rights-respecting regular pathways are a keystone for solutions that reinforce safe, orderly and regular migration, protection of all migrants, and the rebuilding of employment and economies. Too many migrants today remain limited in their options to migrate safely because of constraints associated with their training, skill level, and the sector(s) in which they seek or are offered employment, or discrimination related to their national origin, race or gender. States should therefore commit to broaden the availability of regular pathways across a wider spectrum of sectors, and with more flexible options to remain, leave and return, to be joined by family members, and to be able to use migration to respond to their real-life situations, dangers, and hopes. This includes long-term regular options for climate-displaced migrants. States’ treaty commitments to receive asylum-seekers must be fulfilled, as well as the commitment to non-refoulement, not returning asylum-seekers to countries where they would be at risk. Migrants’ access to public services and justice is key to their ability to protect and claim human rights, including economic and social rights, regardless of migration status. Central to this is combatting racism, xenophobia and discrimination. Nationality, citizenship or migration status should never be a barrier to accessing services and justice. “Firewalls” are needed that prohibit the sharing of information between immigration authorities and service providers, so that undocumented migrants are able to access services without fear of detection, detention or deportation. National, subnational and local policies, strategies and plans including service delivery systems should be inclusive; taking into account all aspects of migrants’ basic rights such as health, education, food, social and other public and social services as well as access to justice. The modus operandi of migration management is replete with the flagrant violation of international refugee"
